//Separate CSS, JS and HTML files
//Some elements are capitalized, but should be lowercase, e.g., BODY => body
//Implicit </p> tags should be made explicit
//Spaces between attributes, the equal sign and the attributes values should be removed
//Put quotes around attribute values
//Move inline style elements into the html level style element
//Indent 2 spaces instead of 4
Take a look at the thead, tbody and tfoot elements for tables
//No inline styles
